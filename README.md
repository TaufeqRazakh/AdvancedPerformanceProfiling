# Advanced Performance Profiling
CSCI 653: High Performance Computing and Simulations (Fall 2022)

## Resource
This section of the homework requires to make an Intel DevCloud account which can be made by signing up / registering fromthe Intel DevCloud OneApi [page](https://software.intel.com/devcloud/oneapi). If you previously made a DevCloud account, the above link can be used to revive an expired account account.

For hekp with logging into the nodes please refer to the documentation under OneApi for DevCloud  (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/connect-with-ssh-linux-macos/)

## Pre-requisite: Installing the profiler and analysis GUI
+ Download & install the latest version of the Intel oneAPI Vtune Profiler GUI from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/vtune-profiler-download.html).

+ Download & install the latest version of the Intel oneAPI Advisor GUI from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html#advisor)

Upon installation, launch the GUI. Depending on your OS, the default installation path would be.
- windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\
- Linux OS: /opt/intel/oneapi/
- mac OS: /opt/intel/oneapi/

## Performance Profiling FMM Implementation

You are already familar with the  a fast algorithm for particle simulations, [Journal of Computational Physics 73,  325â€“
348 (1987)] introduced in assignment 2. VTune is capable of generatng reports for sereval analysis on the application target.

They are
+ performance-snapshot
+ hotspot analysis
+ anomaly-detection
+ memory-consumption
+ micro-architecture exploration
+ memory-access
+ hpc-performance
+ io
+ gpu-offload
+ gpu-hotpost
+ fpga-interactoin
+ system-overview
+ platform-profiler

We will carry out a hotspot analysis and try to understand our program by looking at the profiler report that's generated.

Request a compute node with the command below
```
qsub -I
```
Now run the hotspot analysis
```
vtune --collect hotspots --result-dir rFMMHotspots ./fmm2d
```

With the profiling complete, we will now view the report that is generated by importing the results directory `rFMMHotspots` to our local computer and opening the result file (*vtune) in the VTune proiler GUI.

Once you have completed importing the results, click on the three lines displayed on the left bar of the VTune window and select open > Result > \<*vtune report>
